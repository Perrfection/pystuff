      x_point - an integer that represents where along the x-axis the building will be drawn
      y_point - an integer that represents where along the y-axis the building will be drawn
      Together the x_point and y_point represent the top, left corner of the building

      width - an integer that represents how wide the building will be in pixels.
            A positive integer draws the building right to left(->).
            A negative integer draws the building left to right (<-).
      height - an integer that represents how tall the building will be in pixels
            A positive integer draws the building up 
            A negative integer draws the building down 
      color - a tuple of three elements which represents the color of the building
            Each element being a number from 0 - 255 that represents how much red, green and blue the color should have.

    It depends on:
        pygame being initialized in the environment.
        It depends on a "screen" global variable that represents the surface where the buildings will be drawn
